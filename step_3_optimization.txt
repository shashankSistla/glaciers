* Step 1: Landsat Read: 33 seconds
* Step 2: Compute NDSI: 4 minutes 48 seconds
* Step 3: Project to DEM's CRS: 2 minutes 5 seconds
* Step 4: Get Weighted IP: 3 minutes 16 seconds

* Step 1: landsat images are Read
* Step 2: Iterated through one by one, NDSI calculated conditionally, finally projects rasters to last layer
* Step 3: Projects all to CRS of DEM
* Step 4: Weighted IP, multiple sapply, reprojects

(Takes one NDSI band at a time)
(Then in the function getWeightedIP, loops through each path once, extracting IP along path AND reprojecting)


* Ask about distance = 2.5. should it be a tunable parameter?
* Ask about indices and how the code doesn't really do anything
* Ask about how the 80% thing stops after one of them defaults
