* Add descriptions to every function used in all steps
* Add logging
* Check the DEM data on GEE (above 60 degrees issue)
* Add step wise and total steps time. 
* Remember to add the cost for each final path of the glacier. Costs need to be reported
* In functions.R, point to which file the functions came from originally
* Try various glaciers without pruning and see if anything actually happens

* Ask about ksmooth and unsmooth results

step 1 - prepare dem
step 2 - GD flowline
step 3 - extract intensity profiles
step 4 - candidate termini paths (remove statistics, add it to a step 6)
step 5 - termini path clustering
step 6 - analysis (comparison with ground readings and possibly other outputs)


* Notes:

remoed the 'temporal' argument used in the terminus function. this simply changed the way the number of knots were decided, so this was handled by the config file
