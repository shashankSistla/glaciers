* Add descriptions to every function used in all steps
* make it so that output dir is created only if input file is valid
* Add logging
* Add warnings logging (consult Xinran for this)
* Check the DEM data on GEE (above 60 degrees issue)
* Add step wise and total steps time. 
* Remember to add the cost for each final path of the glacier. Costs need to be reported
* Rename knotS and knotsS (confusing) and add it to knotS. Pull out a function.
* In functions.R, point to which file the functions came from originally
* Undo the transpose ts_int
* Try various glaciers without pruning and see if anything actually happens

step 1 - prepare dem
step 2 - GD flowline
step 3 - extract intensity profiles
step 4 - candidate termini paths (remove statistics, add it to a step 6)
step 5 - termini path clustering
step 6 - analysis (comparison with ground readings and possibly other outputs)
