* Clean code in steps 2,3,4 (consult changes with Xinran, get rid of unecessary code, comments)
* Add descriptions to every function used in all steps
* make it so that output dir is created only if input file exists and is valid
* Add logging
* Add warnings logging (consult Xinran for this)
* Check the DEM data on GEE (above 60 degrees issue)
* Implement glacier list main
* Add number of glaciers (forwards and backwards) as a parameter
* Look into why line.fit is being used
* MAD and other results
* Make a nice readFile function which throws good errors when trying to read a file



step 1 - prepare dem
step 2 - GD flowline
step 3 - extract intensity profiles
step 4 - candidate termini paths (remove statistics, add it to a step 6)
step 5 - termini path clustering
step 6 - analysis (comparison with ground readings and possibly other outputs)
