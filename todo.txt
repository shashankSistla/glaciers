* Clean code in steps 2,3,4 (consult changes with Xinran, get rid of unecessary code, comments)
* Add descriptions to every function used in all steps
* make it so that output dir is created only if input file exists and is valid
* Add logging
* Add warnings logging (consult Xinran for this)
* Check the DEM data on GEE (above 60 degrees issue)
* Add step wise and total steps time. 
* Remember to add the cost for each final path of the glacier. Costs need to be reported
* Rename knotS and knotsS (confusing) and add it to knotS. Pull out a function.
* In functions.R, point to which file the functions came from originally

step 2 - GD flowline

step 5 - termini path clustering
step 6 - analysis (comparison with ground readings and possibly other outputs)
